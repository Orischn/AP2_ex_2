# installations required before running the program

In order for the project to run as it is supposed to, you should install some packages before trying to run the program.

You should download the packages using the next command:

npm i react react-dom react-router-dom react-scripts

# running the program

In order to run the program, you should type the command 'npm start' in the project directory.

After entering this command, the first screen of the projact should be uploaded.

The project will run by default on port 3000.

# signing up

The first page that will be showed to you while running the program is the register page.

In this page, you will need to sign up in order to be able to access the chats page.

The registering process will require you to fill this fields:

- Username (must contain only letters with no numbers and/or special characters)
  This is the name you will use to login to the app after signing up. This username is unique and only you have it.

- Password (must contain at least 8 characters, and include at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 digit. 
  May also contain the special characters '!' and '*').
  We highly recommend choosing a strong password, and a password that isn't already being used elsewhere.
  
  After entering the password you chose, you will need to type it again for confirmation.
  This is the password you will use to login to the app after signing up

- Display name (must contain only letters with no numbers and/or special characters)
  This is the name that will be displayed for your friends and contacts that are also using the app.

- picture
  You should choose some photo from the local storage of your computer.
  This is the photo that will be presented to your friends and contacts.

  After filling all those fields, you will need to confirm that you are not a robot.
  
  Then, if all the fields have appropriate values (indication will be provided when the values aren't matching for some reason),
  you will be transferred to the login page.
  
  # login
  Once you registered correctly to the app, you will be able to login using your username and password.
  Note that you will be able to return to the register page in order to create many more different accounts.
  
  If the details you provide when trying to login will match the details you signed up with, you will be transferred to the chats page,     where the true fun begins.
  
  It's gonna be legen (wait for it)                                                                        dary!
  
  # Chatting
  Now that you signed in correctly, you may start enjoying our app.
  For starters, you can see that the picture and name you chose are displayed on the screen.
  
  Now, We will provide a short tutorial about what is in our program:
  - Option for adding new contacts:
  You will be able to add contacts to your list (note that you will not be able to add unregistered contacts).
   In order to add a new contact, just press the 'add contacts' icon on the left of the screen, and then type the name of the contact you      would like to add. And again, note that if this person is not reistered you won't be able to add him to your contacts.
  
  Once adding a new contact to your list, you will be able to send him as many messages as you want. Isn't that great?
  
  But wait, theres more!
  
  - Support in switching between contacts:
  Imagine that you could not just add many contacts, but you could send all of them as many messages as you like.
  Sound amazing isn't it? Well...
  
  IT IS POSSIBLE!! You will be able to send each one of your contacts all the messages you like.
  
  You think that's it? It's just getting better!
  
  - Searching contatcs:
  Instead of scrolling down the page to find the desired contact, you could type his name in the search bar, and voilà, the contacts with   this name will appear before your eyes.
  - Logout option:
  If for some reason, you will feel that you had enough from our app, I would suggest that you will consider going to therapy because       clearly youre not well. But, if you do want to stop using the app, you could press on the big red button on the right corner (the one     that says 'Logout'), and you will be returned to the login page.
  Note that at this point, the messages you sent before signing out won't be saved when you will log back in (and you will).
  
  Eventually, if you would like to login again you can, and basically you could do anything that you want.
  Except maybe from killing people, or stealing, or driving drunk, or late submitting some of Hemi's targilonim (you should be ashamed if   you did, SHAME ON YOU!). Do what you like as long as its legal and dowsn't violate Geneva Convention.
  
  We hope you will enjoy using our app, and we are (not) open for any improvements that you might have. Adiós.
